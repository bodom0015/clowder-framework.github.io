## 1.8.3 - 2020-04-28
**_Warning:_ This update modifies how information is stored in Elasticsearch for text based searching. To take advantage 
of these changes a reindex of Elasticsearch is required. This can be started by an admin either from GUI or through the API.**

### Changed
- Elasticsearch indexer will now store new metadata fields as strings to avoid unexpected behavior on date fields.
- When reindexing use a temporary index to reindex while the current one is in use then swap.

### Fixed
- Ability to delete tags from sections and files on the file page. 
  [CATS-1046](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/jira/browse/CATS-1046)
  [CATS-1042](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/jira/browse/CATS-1042)
- User-owned resources will now appear in search results regardless of space permissions. 
- Updating space ownership for datasets and collections will correctly reindex those resources for searches.
- Missing index in statistics which would slow down system when inserting download/views.

### Added
- GitHub Actions to compile and test the code base, create documentation and docker images.
- Code of Conduct as MD file (will be displayed by GitHub).
- Templates for Bug, Feature and Pull Request on GitHub.
