## 1.8.1 - 2020-02-05

### Removed
- Removed unused RDF libraries. This was probably used by the rdf/xml functionality that was removed a while back but 
the dependencies were never removed.
- Removed Jena validation of JSON-LD metadata. It was creating a blank graph and clients couldn't upload metadata when 
Clowder runs in a location that doesn't not have access to https://clowderframework.org/contexts/metadata.jsonld. 

### Added
- Scripts to migrate files on disk AWS S3.
  [CATS-1034](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/jira/browse/CATS-1034)

### Changed
- Include collection prefix in path when saving to S3.
- Include length of file in `FileService` when saving the bytes to any backend service. This helps optimize S3 implementation.
- Upgraded sbt from 0.13.0 to 0.13.6 to fix build failures.
