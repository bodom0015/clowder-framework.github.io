## 1.8.4 - 2020-05-15
**_Warning:_ This update modifies how information is stored in Elasticsearch for text based searching. To take advantage 
of these changes a reindex of Elasticsearch is required. This can be started by an admin either from GUI or through the API.**

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug related to improper indexing of files in nested subfolders, which could also affect searching by parent dataset.
